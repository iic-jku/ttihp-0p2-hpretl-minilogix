## How it works

A programmable 8b input, 8b output freely programmable logic block with optional internal feedback. This can serve many purposes, once an FPGA-style configuration SW is available.

## How to test

- Load the logic block in serial mode.
- Test the logic functionality by applying different digital inputs.

## External hardware

Just a way to set digital inputs is needed, plus a way to check the digital outputs.
